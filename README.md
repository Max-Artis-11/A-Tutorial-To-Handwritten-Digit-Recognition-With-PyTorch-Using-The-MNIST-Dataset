# A-Tutorial-To-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-With-PyTorch-Using-The-MNIST-Dataset
A deep learning project using PyTorch to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The model is evaluated on the MNIST dataset, with functions for training, testing, and visualizing predictions. Optimized with the Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss.
